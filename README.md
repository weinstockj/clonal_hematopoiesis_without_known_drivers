This repo contains code for our manuscript *The Genetic Determinants and Genomic Consequences of Non-Leukemogenic Somatic Point Mutations*. 

The structure of this repo is that it contains an R [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) pipeline for reproducing much of the analysis. Note that controlled access data sets,
(e.g., TOPMed WGS) are not included in this repo. 

This repo contains torch code [torch](https://torch.mlverse.org/) code for training the GEM model within the tidymodels ecosystem. 

Please note that `R/data.R` currently contains a few hardcoded paths.
